The year was 1506 and some Roman citizen, while digging around his vineyard on the Esqueline hill, had discovered the entrance to a long-forgotten niche. One can only imagine his amazement as he peered into the darkness, blinking against it, until the group of figures - monumental Laocoon and his struggling sons bound together by writhing serpents - thrust their unspent anguish upon the Renaissance. And Michelangelo, who no doubt standing there and processing Laocoon's torqued torso and blistering muscles, the expression evident not only in the pained faces of the figures, but in every finger digit and calf tendon, thought to himself, "" The Greeks are powerful adversaries. "" In this particular case, the Greeks being Agesandros, Polydoros, and Athendoros of Rhodes, to whom Pliny attributes the sculpture. # I would go further to guess that Michelangelo, sweeping back to Trastevere and the ongoing torments of the Pope - who had enlisted the Florentine to paint his chapd ceiling - swung between elation and annoyance at this feat of marble.

An eye's pupil opens up to 7mm when the observer is young and fully dark-adapted. But maximum dilation shrinks with age. By the time you're 65, pupils may not dilate beyond 5 mm. Because the eye can not use light from an exit pupil bigger than the eye's pupil, a pair of binoculars with an exit pupil larger than a dilated pupil magnifies but does not brighten the view.

Both offer a flash-supporting hot shoe, a battery-saving optical viewfinder, an electronic level dubbed the' Virtual Horizon', a lens with 28mm wide-angle coverage and F2.8 maximum aperture; the Nikon is a hair slimmer and lighter than the Canon.

The 17 buttons on the Coolpix P7000 provide quick short-cuts to the camera's manual controls.

"Thus, a long, westward axial approach could have been realized economically by simply extracting the spina; however, during Sixtus V's short reign no demolition was accomplished. # In the early seventeenth century, Carlo Maderno completed the church construction. Rather than following Bramante and Michelangelo by employing a centralized scheme, he gave it a very long nave and a large facade. In contrast to an architectural solution dominated by the cupola, as recorded, for example, in a fresco in the Vatican Library (Fig. 5), Maderno's facade compromised the view to the dome. Retaining the church's original axial orientation, Maderno's facade is also oblique in relation to the preset obelisk. By most assessments, Maderno's work posed other problems as well. (n7) Deprived of the intended vertically rising bell towers, it presented a rather too-broad image. Maderno's facade added complications to the site, and later architects were keen to fix its errors. # In 1651, the St. Peter's building commission made explicit its intention of opening a thoroughfare.",№5 ЛСВ 3.1 пейзаж,5

At this height he would've been able to see farther but a brown haze hung over the city - typical, for summer - and veiled the horizon.

He thought the preconstruction business strange, the idea of selling someone an apartment they'd never even seen, based completely on glossy brochures like these and promises. Castles in the air.

"Swindon vacations' were a way of forgetting what his future held.' Harry had derided Ockleton's theory at the time. Now, as he stumbled towards the window of his room, he recognized that resentment lay behind his disbelief: resentment that his friendship with Dysart might have an origin he had never dreamed of; that, in lending him a helping hand whenever he could, Dysart had merely been slumming. Harry tugged back the curtains and squinted out at the painful brightness of a frosty morning. Condensation was streaming down the windowpanes, so he wiped one dry with his shirt-cuff to gain a sight of the day. His room was on the first floor of the college, looking down into a narrow street that ran beside it. Straight ahead soared the blank rear wall of another college. Suddenly, as he peered out through the moisture-smeared pane, something near the base of the wall seized his attention: letters spray-painted in white on its blackened surface, forming words he could not, in that instant of recognition, quite believe. Wrenching up the sash, he leaned out for a clearer view. (––-). The unique and unmistakeable characters roared their silent greeting up at him. PROFITIS ILIAS. in Greek. In Oxford.

With an orbital period of 1.9 days, it always remains within 0.8' of the planet. Magnitude 10.4 Dione orbits between these two moons. Enceladus is the most challenging moon for most backyard observers. Glowing at magnitude 11.8 and in a 1.4-day orbit that keeps it forever close to the rings, you'll need a 10-inch scope and good viewing conditions to spot it. # The morning sky brings a fleeting view of Mercury in early April. The innermost planet reached greatest western elongation on the final day of March. For observers at mid-northern latitudes April 1, the magnitude 0.2 object stands 4 high in the east 30 minutes before sunrise. You'll likely need binoculars to pick it out of the brightening twilight. A waning crescent Moon passes 7 north (to the upper left) of the planet on the 8th. # Neither Venus nor Mars appears in April – both lie too near the Sun. Venus will",№5 ЛСВ 3.1 пейзаж,5

"In 1948, the physicist Richard Feynman showed that temporal symmetry exists in particle/antiparticle trajectories. He proved that an antiparticle moving forward in time is the mathematical equivalent of a particle that moves backward in time. To explain this, we imagine that we perceive only a small portion of the total reality that is spread out before us as if it were a landscape. By analogy, this total reality is covered with an opaque sheet of paper and our perception is a horizontal slit cut into it through which we are permitted a partial view. This is shown below in a diagram that follows the world lines of three subatomic particles (Gardner 106): # Because time moves forward for us, our perception (the horizontal slit) moves up the page, allowing us to eventually see all three particles (Electron A, Positron, and Electron B).

This footage speaks to a novice operator who is actively filming the event, creating an intersection between the censure of Glen's actions and a privileged outside perspective that is indeed fueling these actions.
